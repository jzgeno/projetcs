<h1>Paquita</h1>
Paquita is originally a two-act ballet to music by music by Ã‰douard Deldevez and Ludwig Minkus. This romantic ballet tells the story of Paquita, a beautiful girl who was saved by a gypsy family as an infant from a pirate massacre. As a result of her social standing, her romance with a French nobleman, Lucien, is forbidden. Yet, as she travels around, the gypsies help Paquita find her real family, and when it is discovered that she is the daughter of a nobleman, Paquita and Lucien finally reunite!</p>

<h1>The Nutcracker</h1>
This classical tradition is fun for all ages! Follow along as we tell the story of Clara, whose Christmas present of a toy Nutcracker comes to life before her eyes. This is an annual production of our company that we take lots of pride in. When searching for a show to see, the Nutcracker never fails to disappoint.</p>

<h1>Copelia</h1>
<p>Doctor Coppelius has handcrafted a beautiful, very realistic mechanical doll, who fools all the villagers into thinking that she is a real girl. Curiously motivated, he tries to use magic to bring the doll to life. This show is filled with drama and will certainly keep everyone entertained.</p>
